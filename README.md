REPOSITORY OVERVIEW

This repository contains 60% of the FOCP (Fundamental of computer programming) Final assignment, as required by our university. 
All files included in this repository strictly follows the guidelines and structure provided during the course.
The repository contains a total of three (3) files:
Logbook
Notebook
Project Program

REPOSITORY CONTENTS 
LOGBOOK
The Logbook documents:
Weekly exercises
Notes and concepts practiced during regular class sessions
Step-by-step learning progress throughout the course
It serves as a record of continuous learning and classroom activities.

NOTEBOOK
The  Notebook includes:
Practical programs performed during class sessions
Hands-on exercises based on taught concepts
Implementation of theoretical knowledge into practical code

PROJECT PROGRAM
The Project Program represents the final project submission and consists of two tasks, as instructed
This file demonstrates:
Practical application of FOCP concepts
Structured and organized programming approach
Problem-solving skills developed during the course


TOPICS COVERED 
Throughout the regular classes and the final project, the following topics were covered and implemented:

User Input & Output
Getting data from users and displaying results
Data Validation
Checking user inputs for correctness and handling invalid data
Mathematical Operations
Performing calculations and formatting numerical output
Control Structures
Using loops and conditional statements (if-else, loops)
String Manipulation
Reading and processing data from external files
Functions
Organizing code into reusable and modular components
Error Handling
Managing exceptions and handling runtime errors gracefully

CONCLUSION

This repository successfully demonstrates the learning outcomes of the FOCP course, covering both 
theoreticalunderstanding and practical implementation.All required components have been completed 
and organized 
according to institutional instructions.
