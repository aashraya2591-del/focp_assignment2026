Project Overview

This repository contains a series of Python programming assignments designed to practice fundamental programming concepts. The tasks progressively build skills in area like input handling, data validation, calculations, control structures, and file operations.

Each task is a standalone Python program that can be run independently. The assignments are part of the weekly practical in the Fundamental of Computer Programming course and demonstrate practical applications of core python concepts.

Programs Objective 

The collection includes various types of programs:

•	Calculations programs that perform mathematical operations and display formatted results.

•	Validation programs that check user input for correctness and security

•	File handling programs that read and process data from external files.

All Programs are interactive, accepting user input through the terminal and providing clear output messages. They include proper error handling to manage invalid inputs gracefully.

How to Run The programs

Step 1: Navigate to the Directory

Cd notebook/focp_practical/practical-n

Step 2 : Run any task

Python task1.py

Python task 2.py

Python task 10.py


For other Operating system

Mac/Linux: Use python3 instead of python

Windows: Use .py  if python doesn’t work:

Programming Concepts Covered 

This assignment series covers essential programming Fundamentals:

•	User Inputs & Output: Getting data from users and displaying results

•	Data Validation: Checking inputs for correctness and handling errors

•	Mathematical Operations: Performing calculations and formatting numbers

•	Control structure: Using loops and conditional statements 

•	String manipulation: Reading data from external files

•	Functions: Organizing code into reusable components

•	Error Handling: Managing exceptions and invalid inputs.

Troubleshooting

“Python is not recognized”

Install python from python.org

If problem occurs even after installing navigate the installation folder for python and manually add the path of the python in environmental variables.

“No such file or directory”

•	Make sure you’re in the correct folder 

•	Check that the .py files exist

“Task 10 not working”

•	Ensure info.txt exists in the same folder

•	Check file permissions
